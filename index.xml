      <description>Working Papers A Divergence-free Velocity Reconstruction for Fluid Simulation (as Undergraduate Thesis) This paper proposes a particle-in-cell style method, which based on the port-Hamiltonian formulation, to enhance continuity near interfaces when simulating multi-phase flow. We employ the enhanced particle-in-cell method to ensure phase variables bounded and deploy an interpolation method based on vector potential for multiply connected domains. This paper experimentally justifies the enhanced particle-in-cell method and elucidate the importance of divergence-free velocity field.</description>

      <description>Hello, I&#39;m Yuechen Zhu üëã I got my Bachelor&#39;s degree in Computer Science and Technology, Turing Class, Peking University. During my undergraduate years, I work closely with Dr. Bin Wang and Prof. Baoquan Chen. I am seeking for PhD opportunities.&#xA;My research interests lie in physical simulations, Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG) , and Computer Graphics (CG) in general. I would like to apply fields like differential geometry, differential equations, and computational mathematics to offer more intuitive and profound insights into our understanding of the world.</description>
